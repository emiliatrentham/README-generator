# Node.js README.md Generator

## Description 

This is a command-line application that runs with Node.js that dynamically generates a README.md file based on input about your project. Check out the [`ExampleREADME.md`]() in this repo as an example.

## Installation

To generate your own README, `git clone` the repo down to your local so you have the Node project on your local.

Run `npm install` in order to install the following npm package dependencies as specified in the `package.json`:

  * [`inquirer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) will prompt you for your inputs from the command line.
  * [`axios`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) will fetch your info from the GitHub API.

The application will start by running `node index.js` in the command line.

Answer the prompts in your command line to generate the README.

After answering all the prompts, your README file will be named 'ExampleREADME.md' and will be ready for you at the root of the repo.

The README has some automatically generated badges for your repo courtesy of shields.io and will include your profile picture & email from GitHub.


## Usage 

![Gif demo of README-generator](readme-demo.gif)

When you run `node index.js`, the application uses the `inquirer` package to prompt you in the command line with a series of questions about your GitHub and about your project.

The application then takes your responses and uses `axios` to fetch your GitHub profile from the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/), including your GitHub profile picture (avatar) and email.
From there, the application will generate markdown and a table of contents for the README conditionally based on your responses to the Inquirer prompts (so, if you don't answer the optional questions, such as Installation, an Installation section will not be included in your README). The README will also include badges for your GitHub repo.

Finally, `fs.writeFile` is used to generate your project's README.md file. Check out the [`ExampleREADME.md`](https://github.com/connietran-dev/readme-generator/blob/master/ExampleREADME.md) in this repo as an example on the final output. 

## Methodology

The application utilizes modularization by separating the GitHub API call and generation of the markdown into separate modules: `api.js` and `generateMarkdown.js`, respectively, inside the `utils` folder.

The application also uses syntax and paradigms introduced in ES6 and beyond, including:

- Arrow functions, 
- `const`, `let`, 
- Template literals, and
- `async/await` to handle `inquirer`, `axios`, and `fs.writeFile` promises.
